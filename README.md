# elm-tetris

This is a toy implementation of Tetris that I created for exploring the elm programming language.  Since I primarily work on backend components using imperative languages, I wanted to experiment with something completely different.  The project took approximately two evenings (one to get things working and one for polishing / refactoring).

## Controls

- `Up` rotates the piece counterclockwise
- `Left` and `Right` move the piece
- `Down` drops the piece by one line
- `Space` drops the piece all the way

## Try it!
